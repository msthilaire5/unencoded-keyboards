    <h2>About <b>Script Key</b></h2>
	<p> We want to create a tool to crowdsource symbols for languages that are not supported by Unicode.
    This allows users to send messages in under-resourced scripts/languages and allows developers to access a library of symbol
    images for future developments of Unicode and fonts. This is scientifically interesting because it allows us to bring together
    a combination of image recognition technology and natural language processing, expanding language support in the digital world.
    The potential prototype that would be created would most likely take the form of a web application, with a focus on simplicity and useability.

    This would address language justice in a few ways: first, the product’s development would focus on accessibility for speakers who
    might not have the technical skills, or have a language widespread enough, to find support in other places in the technical community.
    In addition, this could theoretically decrease the time required to take an unencoded language and encode it. In a more practical sense,
    development of a solution like this can have massive implications in several different contexts such as day-to-day messaging or emailing,
    communicating with patients in hospitals, and diversifying documentation tools.
